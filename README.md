# Asteroid Collision Solution

## Intuition
The idea is simple — if you can absorb a smaller or equal-sized asteroid, your mass increases by its size. To maximize survival chances, absorb smaller asteroids first. Sorting the list ensures you always encounter the smallest possible asteroid next.

## Approach
1. **Sort** the list of asteroids in ascending order.
2. Iterate over the sorted asteroids:
   - If the asteroid’s size is less than or equal to the current mass, absorb it and increase your mass.
   - If you encounter an asteroid larger than your current mass, you can't absorb it — return `False`.
3. If all asteroids are absorbed successfully, return `True`.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  $$O(n \log n)$$  
  (because of sorting the list of `n` asteroids)

- **Space complexity:**  $$O(1)$$  
  (if sorting in-place — otherwise $$O(n)$$ depending on the language’s sorting implementation)

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidsDestroyed(self, mass: int, asteroids: List[int]) -> bool:
        ast = sorted(asteroids)
        for a in ast:
            if a <= mass:
                mass += a
            else:
                return False
        return True
