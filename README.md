# 11. Container with the Most Water - LeetCode (Medium)

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Container with the Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## üí° Intuition

We use two-pointer algorithm to find the area of the largest container. Using two loops would make time complexity  $$O(n^2)$$, which is a lot. Therefore, we shall have one pointer at the start of the array and one pointer at the end. Both move towards each other and area is continuously calculated at each iteration.  

## üß† Approach
1. Assign `i = 0` which is the pointer at the start and `j = len(height) - 1` as pointer at the end.
2. Run a while loop with the condition that `i!=j`
3. `a = min(height[i],height[j]) * (j-i)` stores area at that particular iteration
4. `area` stores maximum of all the areas found.
5. Only one pointer changes value after each iteration and that is decided by their heights. If `height[i] > height[j]` then pointer j is shifted to the left (decreased by 1) and if `height[j] > height[i]`, pointer i is shifted to the right, that is increased by 1.

## ‚è± Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` as we pass through the list only once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` since we are tracking only one variable.

**This solution beats 90.56% solutions in terms of space complexity**


## üì¶ Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        area = 0
        j = len(height) - 1
        i = 0
        while i != j:
            a = min(height[i],height[j]) * (j-i)
            area = max(a,area)
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return area

# 34. Find First and Last Position of Target in Array - LeetCode (Medium)

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Find First and Last Position of Target in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

## üí° Intuition

We use binary search (via the `bisect` module) to find the leftmost and rightmost indices where the target occurs in the sorted array.

- **Left Bound:** The first position where the target can be inserted (or the first occurrence of the target).
- **Right Bound:** The last position where the target can be inserted (or the last occurrence of the target).

## üß† Approach

1. **Find Left Bound:** Use `bisect_left` to find the leftmost position where the target can be inserted (or the first occurrence of the target).
2. **Find Right Bound:** Use `bisect_right` to find the rightmost position and subtract `1` to get the index of the last occurrence of the target.
3. **Check for Target:** If the target is not found in the list, return `[-1, -1]`.
4. **Return Result:** If the target exists, return the range `[left, right]`.

## ‚è± Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` for both `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` operations.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (excluding the input and output).

## üì¶ Code

```python
import bisect
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Find the leftmost position for the target
        left = bisect.bisect_left(nums, target)
        
        # Find the rightmost position for the target
        right = bisect.bisect_right(nums, target) - 1
        
        # If the target is not found, return [-1, -1]
        if left == len(nums) or nums[left] != target:
            left = right = -1
        
        return [left, right]
```

# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II - LeetCode (Medium)

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

## üí° Intuition
As we look as the example questions, we can see that regardless of what the stocks are, they are being bought and sold on the very next day, and then bought again and sold on the very next day, as many times as possible to get the highest profit. 

## üß† Approach

1. We first set max_profit as 0.
2. We loop through `prices`
3. if `prices[i] - prices[i-1] > 0` then `max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]`
4. return max_profit

## ‚è± Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (As we run a single for loop)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` 

## üì¶ Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] - prices[i-1] > 0:
                max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        return max_profit

# 151. Reverse Words - LeetCode (Medium)

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Reverse Words of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The goal is to reverse the **order** of words, not the characters within them.  
First thought: use Python's built-in string handling to strip extra spaces, split the words, reverse the list, and join them with a single space.

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Use `strip()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace.
2. Use `split()` to break the string into words ‚Äî this automatically handles multiple spaces.
3. Reverse the list of words using slicing (`[::-1]`).
4. Use `' '.join(...)` to combine the words into a single space-separated string.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:  
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->  
$$O(n)$$ ‚Äî where *n* is the length of the input string. We traverse the string a few times: stripping, splitting, and joining.

- Space complexity:  
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->  
$$O(n)$$ ‚Äî for storing the list of words and the final output string.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = []
        s = s.strip()  # Remove leading/trailing spaces
        k = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == ' ':
                # Only add non-empty words (skip multiple spaces)
                if s[k:i] != '':
                    words.append(s[k:i])
                k = i + 1

        # Add the last word (after the loop ends)
        if s[k:] != '':
            words.append(s[k:])

        print("Before reversing:", words)
        words = words[::-1]
        print("After reversing:", words)

        # Join words with a single space
        return ' '.join(words)
```
## Or we can simply use the pythonic one liner: 
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        return ' '.join(s.strip().split()[::-1])
```

# 167. Two Sum II (Array Input is Sorted)- LeetCode (Medium)

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Two Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

## üí° Intuition

- Use Two Pointer algorithm to find the two indicies which add up to the target.
- It is even simpler since the array is already sorted.

## üß† Approach

1. Initialise `i` to `0` and `j` to `len(numbers) - 1`. They will serve as out index positions.
2. Run a while loop with the condition `i<j`
3. If `numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target` then return `i+1` and `j+1` in the form of a list.
4. Else, check if `numbers[i] + numbers[j]` is greater or lesser than target.
5. If it is greater, means a smaller number is required, therefore shift `j -=1`
6. Otherwise shift `i+=1`

## ‚è± Time Complexity

- **Time:** O(n) - only one while loop
- **Space:** O(1) - no extra space used

## üì¶ Code

```python
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        i = 0
        j = len(numbers) - 1
        s = 0
        while (i<j):
            if target == (numbers[i] + numbers[j]):
                return [i+1,j+1]
            else:
                if target > (numbers[i] + numbers[j]):
                    i += 1
                else:
                    j -= 1

# 169. Majority Element - LeetCode

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

## üí° Intuition
I needed to find the element that appears more than `n/2` times in a list. My initial thought was to count how often each element appears, and `collections.Counter` instantly came to mind‚Äîit‚Äôs built for this exact task.

## üß† Approach
1. I used `Counter` from Python‚Äôs `collections` module to count frequencies of all elements in the list.
2. Then I looped through the counted elements and returned the one that appears at least `n//2` times.

> Note: Technically, the majority element appears **more than** `n/2` times, not just `>=`, but the problem guarantees a majority exists, so this approach works.

## ‚úÖ Code

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = Counter(nums)
        for i in count:
            if count[i] >= (len(nums) // 2):
                return i

# 238. Product of Array Except Self - LeetCode (Medium)

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

## üí° Intuition

- The brute-force approach calculates the product for each index by multiplying all the other numbers in the array, but this takes O(n^2) time.
- The optimal solution avoids using division by using prefix and suffix arrays to hold the running product from the left and the right.

## üß† Approach

- Initialize an array `result` to hold the final products.
- Use two passes through the array: one to calculate the prefix product and one to calculate the suffix product.
- Multiply the prefix and suffix products for each index to get the final product except self for that index.

## ‚è± Time Complexity

- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(1) (excluding output array)

## üì¶ Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        product = 1
        zero_count = 0

        for num in nums:
            if num == 0:
                zero_count += 1
            else:
                product *= num

        result = []
        for num in nums:
            if zero_count == 0:
                result.append(product // num)
            elif zero_count == 1:
                if num == 0:
                    result.append(product)
                else:
                    result.append(0)
            else:
                result.append(0)

# 345. Reverse Vowels of a String - LeetCode

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Reverse Vowels of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/)

## ‚úÖ Intuition
My first thought was: ‚ÄúWe only care about vowels ‚Äî so let‚Äôs grab them, reverse them, and drop them back in like nothing happened.‚Äù

We don‚Äôt need to reverse the whole string or worry about consonants. Just treat the vowels like VIPs, reverse their order, and stitch them back while keeping all other characters in place.

## üß† Approach
1. Convert the string into a list so it's mutable.
2. Create a list of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase, 'cause equality).
3. Iterate through the string and store all vowels in a separate list.
4. Loop through the string again ‚Äî when a vowel is encountered, replace it with the corresponding vowel from the reversed list.
5. Finally, join the list back into a string and return it.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  $$O(n)$$  
  (One pass to collect vowels, one to replace them ‚Äî linear time overall)

- **Space complexity:**  $$O(n)$$  
  (We're storing the string as a list and the vowels separately ‚Äî both proportional to the size of the input.)

## üíª Code

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = list(s)
        vowels = ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
        v = []
        for i in s:
            if i in vowels:
                v.append(i)
        j = 1
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in vowels:
                s[i] = v[len(v) - j]
                j += 1
        return ''.join(s)

# 781. Rabbits in Forest - LeetCode (Medium)

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Rabbits in Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/rabbits-in-forset/)

## ‚úÖ Intuition
The group size is always gonna be `answers[i] + 1` as it refers to rabbits of same colour *excluding* itself. Number of groups is therefore given by `num_groups = math.ceil(count[x] / group_size)` and total will be continued sum of number of groups multipled by group size.

## üß† Approach
1. Import Counter and count freq of every element in answers
2. Loop through each of the elements in count
3. Find group size and number of groups.


## Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  $$O(n + k)$$  where k is number of unique values in `answers`

- **Space complexity:**  $$O(n)$$  

## üíª Code

```python
from collections import Counter
import math

class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers: List[int]) -> int:
        count = Counter(answers)
        total = 0
        
        for i in count:
            group_size = i+1
            num_groups = math.ceil(count[i] / group_size)
            total += num_groups * group_size

# 2126. Asteroid Collision Solution

## Intuition
The idea is simple ‚Äî if you can absorb a smaller or equal-sized asteroid, your mass increases by its size. To maximize survival chances, absorb smaller asteroids first. Sorting the list ensures you always encounter the smallest possible asteroid next.

## Approach
1. **Sort** the list of asteroids in ascending order.
2. Iterate over the sorted asteroids:
   - If the asteroid‚Äôs size is less than or equal to the current mass, absorb it and increase your mass.
   - If you encounter an asteroid larger than your current mass, you can't absorb it ‚Äî return `False`.
3. If all asteroids are absorbed successfully, return `True`.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  $$O(n \log n)$$  
  (because of sorting the list of `n` asteroids)

- **Space complexity:**  $$O(1)$$  
  (if sorting in-place ‚Äî otherwise $$O(n)$$ depending on the language‚Äôs sorting implementation)

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidsDestroyed(self, mass: int, asteroids: List[int]) -> bool:
        ast = sorted(asteroids)
        for a in ast:
            if a <= mass:
                mass += a
            else:
                return False
        return True

# 2563. Count the Number of Fair Pairs - LeetCode (Medium)

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Count the Number of Fair Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-fair-pairs/)

## üí° Intuition
We ust find the number of pairs that lie between `lower` and `upper`. Brute force two-point algorithm can be used, but that would lead to time complexity as 0(n^2), which results in TLE. Threrefore, we follow sort + binary-search. Since python has built in library called `bisect` for binary search operations, it becomes a lot easier. 

## üß† Approach
1. First sort the array
2. Loop through the elements using a simple for loop.
3. `min_val` = `lower` - nums[i]
4. `max_val` = `upper` - nums[i]
5. Using bisect, we find out the leftmost and rightmost values that obey the conditions of a fair pair.
6. Add these values to `pairs`

## ‚è± Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  $$O(nlog n)$$  
  (because of sorting the list of `n` elements and using binary search)

- **Space complexity:**  $$O(1)$$  
  (We're only using constant extra space (O(1)), aside from sorting the input list in-place)

## ‚úÖ Code

```python
import bisect
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countFairPairs(self, nums: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:
        nums = sorted(nums)
        pairs = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            min_val = lower - nums[i]
            max_val = upper - nums[i]

            left = bisect.bisect_left(nums, min_val, i+1)
            right = bisect.bisect_right(nums, max_val, i+1)

            pairs += (right - left)

# 2563. Count Complete Subarrays - LeetCode (Medium)

## üîó Problem Link
[LeetCode - Count Complete Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-subarrays-in-an-array/)

## üí° Intuition
Simple way to count the number of distinct elements in the input array and compare it to the elements in subarrays. We use `set` to find out distinct elements irrespective of its order. 

## üß† Approach
1. Compute `fullset = set(nums)`. This stores distinct elements from `nums`
2. Run a for loop through the list `nums` and set value of `current` to `set()`, this will count number of distinct elements in the subarray.
3. Run another for loop through the list starting from `i+1`, add each value of `nums[j]` to `current` and check if it is equal to `fullset`
4. If `currect == fullset` then `total += 1`
5. Return `total`

## ‚è± Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  $$O(n ^ 2)$$  
  (because it has one outer loop and one inner loop)

- **Space complexity:**  $$O(n)$$  
  (because it stores only two sets: `fullset` and `current`)

## ‚úÖ Code

```python
from typing import List

            for j in range(i, len(nums)):
                curr_set.add(nums[j])
                if curr_set == full_set:
